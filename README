# 🕹️ Snake Game
Snake game is a classic online game built using Java and the Swing GUI toolkit & API. The game is keyboard controlled where a growing snake collects food and avoids collisions. For me, this project began as a learning exercise to improve my knowledge of using Java OOP and Swift to build interactive games. I started with a tutorial to build the game but have since extended it with custom features and design improvements to make it my own.


## What I learned
- Swing GUI toolkit & API applications
- Handling keyboard input and real-time updates
- Structuring object-oritented code for an interactive game

## Added Features
- Game customization
- - The user can customize the snake and game frame with color
- Movement with arrow keys
